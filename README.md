## Hi! I'm Dhruv Banerjee 

#### I'm a student at the London School of Economics, interested in the intersection of data science and public policy

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about how to use Data Science, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis with reference to policy-related areas such as education, health, and economics

- 🔭 I’m working on understanding better how data science and AI can be most beneficially incorporated into public services, and regulated to reduce risk without stifling growth. I genuinely believe that if used properly, technologies such as AI can evenly spread out economic growth.
