## Hi! I'm Dhruv, a student at the London School of Economics, interested in the intersection of data science and public policy

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about how to use Data Science, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis with reference to policy-related areas such as education, health, and economics

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on understanding better how data science and AI can be most beneficially incorporated into public services, and regulated to reduce risk without stifling growth. I genuinely believe that if used properly, technologies such as AI can evenly spread out economic growth.
